# Namaste &#128591; I'am Andry Basaraba
I just started the  web developer course by Neue Fische.

You definitely didn't know that about me:

1. Сertified yoga teacher
2. Studied in India for 3 months and practiced every day by the ocean
3. I love my family more than anything

>🚀 The next **3 months** will be very exiting time, as I will learn new things every day.
